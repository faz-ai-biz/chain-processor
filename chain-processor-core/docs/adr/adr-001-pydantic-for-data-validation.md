# ADR-001: Pydantic for Data Validation

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The Chain Processing System requires a robust data validation mechanism for its domain models. We need to ensure that data is validated at the boundaries, serialized correctly, and easy to work with across different services.

## Decision
We will use Pydantic (version â‰¥ 2.11.0) as the foundation for all domain models in the system. Specifically:

1. All domain models will be defined as Pydantic models
2. We will use Pydantic's validation features to enforce data constraints
3. We will use Pydantic's serialization capabilities for JSON conversion
4. We will take advantage of Python type hints along with Pydantic for better IDE support and static analysis

## Consequences
### Positive
- Strong validation at runtime with clear error messages
- Automatic serialization/deserialization to/from JSON
- Better development experience with IDE autocompletion
- Built-in schema generation for documentation
- Consistent model definitions across services

### Negative
- Learning curve for developers unfamiliar with Pydantic
- Potential performance overhead for validation of complex models

## Alternatives Considered
1. **Marshmallow**: Good serialization library but lacks the integration with Python's type system
2. **Dataclasses with custom validation**: More work to implement, less standardized
3. **Custom validation code**: Would require more maintenance and testing
